# SECURITY POLICY

D'Anchor is an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a database. Employees of the company regularly query, and/or request data from the database.

As a Security Analyst consultant for D'Anchor, I created a security policy that will be a guideline in securing both employees and organisation.

The policy covers the purpose, scope, device security, password, email, internet access and disciplinary action.
